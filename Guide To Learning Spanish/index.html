        <title>Learning Spanish: My personal experince after 2 years</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>A Beginner's Guide</h1>
    <p>Hola a todos!</p>

    <p>I have been learning spanish for a little over 2 years now and was able to reach fluency during that time. Because i often see people ask questions like "how to start learning spanish?" I wanted to share everything i did during that time period in order to give newcomers somewhere to start.</p>

    <p>First of all I want to say that i am a huge proponent of Stephen Krashens Natural Approach and Comprehensible Input Theory and you will definitely see that my main focus with spanish was consuming tons of input in order to acquire the language instead of actively learning it.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind, these are just my personal preferences and completely based on my experience. You may get better results doing something else, I had a lot of fun studying spanish this way and I think that's the most important thing.</p>
    <h3>What do you need in order to learn a language?</h3>
    <p>During all this time of studying spanish, I think 3 factors have made the biggest difference in my personal journey:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Habit: it is very important to establish the habit of doing something in spanish every day, for example listening to music, reading articles, learning some vocabulary, talking with people, whatever it is, the sooner you have this habit locked in, the faster you will see results, think about it like a compound interest, over time, you will have significant progress without even noticing it</li>
        <li>Personal motivation: even though it can be motivating to have to learn a language for your work, there is no better motivation than your personal wish to learn a language. So keep your personal motivation high, think about things why you wanted to learn spanish in the first place and studying will never even come close to feeling like a chore</li>
        <li>Fun: Do things that you would normally enjoy doing in your native language. I love reading books, so i have read more than 20 books in spanish during those 2 years, i also love Series and Movies so I spent hundreds if not thousands of hours watching Spanish content.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Where to start?</h3>
    <p>Even though i am a proponent of consuming input, i think it is a good idea to have some basic structural knowledge of the language itself, how does basic grammar work (things like prepositions, pronouns, conjugation...).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AIB Spanish For Beginners Video Series on YouTube (by Dr. Danny Evans) gives a great overview of various grammatical concepts in short videos. Also check out his personal YouTube Channel "The Language Tutor" for even more Videos.</li>
        <li>Language Transfer - Complete Spanish (YT or App). This course is fantastic. It gives you a very intuitive knowledge of spanish structures and explains a lot of interesting commonalities between english and spanish for example.</li>
        <li>Dreaming Spanish YouTube - Superbeginner Videos: These Videos are amazing. This might be the most valuable resource out there for beginning spanish learners. Comprehensible Input specifically aimed for learners is extremely rare and as spanish students we are very fortunate to have this Channel at our disposal.</li>
        <li>Easy Spanish: Interviews from Spain, Mexico and Argentina that are conducted with people on the streets, so you get a real good idea of the "real spoken" spanish from these countries. Include also subtitles so very nice for beginners.</li>
        <li>Anki SRS System: Learning a language is very overwhelming in the beginning phase, because there is so much to learn and one can feel a little bit lost. Therefore i think it is valuable to learn important words with a spaced repetition system like Anki, for example the 100 most important spanish verbs, the most important prepositions and so on... later on when you have a good grasp of the language I would not advise to learn vocabulary actively but rather read a lot of books in order to acquire it naturally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Most valuable resources</h3>
    <p>The above list gives a great introduction for new students, while the following resources are generally things that you can be doing for a longer time and that are not necessarily aimed for beginners.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assimil Spanish with Ease: This course is just fantastic. In my opinion it covers the most important aspects of language study: Listening, Reading, Speaking, without much focus on the grammar itself. Starting Assimil can be a little overwhelming at first because it jumps right in to conversation, but once you get the gist of it it is extremely efficient and also a lot of fun. Make sure to google "How to Assimil" to get the most out of this course.</li>
        <li>Streaming Services: Once you get a basic understanding of spanish and are able to follow basic conversations, i highly recommend starting to watch Series, Movies and whatever content you are interested in. In the beginning I would recommend to use spanish subtitles (i did this for at least 1-1.5 years) and then turning them off when you feel ready for it.</li>
        <li>Books/ReadLang: In order to read books in spanish i always use the free ReadLang Website. You can upload your spanish eBooks for your private use on ReadLang and read them on the website. Why do that? Because it has an integrated dictionary that not only gives you the meaning of the word, but also various options for pronunciation (spanish, argentinian and mexican). It is a lot quicker than classic eBook Readers like Kindle because you only have to click on the word and get the translation immediately, therefore the reading flow is not interrupted so much.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Book recommendations</h3>
    <p>Here goes the list of books I read in Spanish, I pretty much enjoyed every single one of them, so i will not go in detail or rate them, just to give you some inspiration.</p>
